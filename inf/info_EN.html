        <dt>How to Program Java, Kotlin, and Clojure Simultaneously</dt>
        <dt>Integration of Java, Kotlin and Clojure in one software product</dt>
        <dt>Comparative analysis of programming in Java, Kotlin and Clojure</dt>

      </strong>
        <dt>The article and examples provide a comparative analysis of programming in Java, Kotlin and Clojure using the Eclipse programming environment and the Gradle build system.</dt>
        <dt>Case studies are being developed in Java, Kotlin, and Clojure to provide the foundation for various graphic user interface applications.</dt>
        <dt>Programming is carried out in the same way in all programming languages in order to be able to compare program elements.</dt>
        <dt>The examples are intended as a basis for creating programs with a graphical interface with the possibility of its extension for any application.</dt>
        <dt>The expansion of the developed programs will continue towards the creation of a multi-module system with an unchanged head and with the ability to load into it functional modules from the repository, written both in Java and in Kotlin or Clojure. The open type of the depository is supposed to allow any developer to present his modules in it for demonstration or use.</dt>
        <dt>The possibility of supplementing this development with Scala (Java) and Python programming languages is being considered.</dt>
